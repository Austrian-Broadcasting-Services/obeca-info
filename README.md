# Welcome to the Open Broadcast Edge Cache Appliance (OBECA) project
This is the starting point for information about the OBECA project.

Open Broadcast Edge Cache Appliance (OBECA) is a platform to

* **receive 5G broadcast** (5G BC) in dedicated mode, i.e. using 100 % downlink capacity (also known as EnTV/FeMBMS in 3GPP Rel.14 and LTE-based 5G Terrestrial Broadcast in 3GPP Rel.16)
* **combine** 5G BC **with** common (5G) (mobile) **broadband**, process and **cache** it for applications
* **develop interactive applications** and proof-of-concepts for hybrid distribution **for broadcasters**
