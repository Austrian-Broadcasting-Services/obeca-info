# Welcome to the Open Broadcast Edge Cache Appliance (OBECA) project
This is the starting point for information about the OBECA project.

Open Broadcast Edge Cache Appliance (OBECA) is a platform to

* **receive 5G broadcast** (5G BC) in dedicated mode, i.e. using 100 % downlink capacity (also known as EnTV/FeMBMS in 3GPP Rel.14 and LTE-based 5G Terrestrial Broadcast in 3GPP Rel.16)
* **combine** 5G BC **with** common (5G) (mobile) **broadband**, process and **cache** it for applications
* **develop interactive applications** and proof-of-concepts for hybrid distribution **for broadcasters**

**Important note: The OBECA project is currently transfered to the <a href="https://github.com/5G-MAG/Documentation-and-Architecture">5G-MAG Reference Tools</a> on Github (further development is planned to be done in 5G-MAG RT only). General information : https://www.5g-mag.com/reference-tools**
